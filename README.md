Optimal Experimental Design for Fractional Polynomials models

Interactive Applet (developed using Mathematica) to generate Optimal Experimental Design for Fractional Polynomial models up to degree 3.
By Víctor Casero-Alonso, Jesús López-Fidalgo and Weng Kee Wong (with the help of Diego Urruchi).

To run our "app", the free Wolfram Player from wolfram.com is needed (or a version 8 or higher of Mathematica software).
